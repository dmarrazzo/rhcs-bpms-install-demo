App Dev Cloud with JBoss BPM Suite Install Demo 
===============================================
This demo is to install JBoss BPM Suite in the Cloud based on leveraging any Red Hat OpenShift container based platform such as:

 - [Red Hat Container Platform (OCP)](https://github.com/redhatdemocentral/ocp-install-demo)

  - or your own OpenShift installation.

Notes
-----
This project can be installed on any OpenShift platform, such as the Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK) or OpenShift Container
Platform (OCP). Itis possible to install it on any available installation, just point this installer at your installation by passing
an IP of your OpenShift installation:
```
  $ ./init.sh IP"
```

Should your local network DNS not handle the resolution of the above address, giving you page not found errors, you can apply the
following to your local hosts file:

```
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

# add host for OCP demo resulution
192.168.99.100   rhcs-bpms-install-demo.192.168.99.100.xip.io

# add host for CDK demo resolution.
10.1.2.2   rhcs-bpms-install-demo.10.1.2.2.xip.io
```
